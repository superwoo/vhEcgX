                             * The parent directory does not exist, cannot be created, or disallows writing.
                             * The persistent store is not accessible, due to permissions or data protection when the device is locked.
                             * The device is out of space.
                             * The store could not be migrated to the current model version.
                             Check the error message to determine what the actual problem was.
